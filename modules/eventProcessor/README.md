The code that 'executes' the events.

Note that the events can be interpreted in multiple ways. We can easily make new event processors

For example
* We can 'do the normal thing' and return 'the data represented by the events'
* we can collate the events to get 'audit' which is a list of the changes
* We could count the number of events, or return a count of who has changed what
