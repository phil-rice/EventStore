Why can't I make up a pipeline in a language, then execute it?

For example

inputs:
   just one namespace/name or many, and what does the output of this stage look like?

Event processing
   One/Many/Merging etc

Post processing
   Pipelines

---

OK why?

Answer: 
* it's 'self service'
* Especially with the post processing doing json transformation
